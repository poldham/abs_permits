title: "The Nagoya Protocol: A Model Online Research Permit and Monitoring System"
output: html_document
---
This is the project site for a model Online Research Permit and Monitoring System to support national implementation of the [Nagoya Protocol](https://www.cbd.int/abs/about/). 

The idea behind the model is to assist Parties to the [Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization](https://www.cbd.int/abs/about/) of the [United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity](https://www.cbd.int) with implementing the Nagoya Protocol. 

The model focuses on the creation of an online permit and monitoring system to make it easier for governments to administer research permit applications involving genetic resources and traditional knowledge and to monitor compliance under the Nagoya Protocol as well as making it easier to prepare national reports. 

### Download in Word and PDF

You can download Word versions of the sections in a .zip file [here](https://github.com/poldham/abs_permits/blob/gh-pages/sections/word.zip?raw=true). For pdf versions go [here](https://github.com/poldham/abs_permits/blob/gh-pages/sections/pdf.zip?raw=true).

You will also need to view the schematics which demonstrate the basic functions of the system. You can view them online from the Schematics menu or download them in [powerpoint](https://github.com/poldham/abs_permits/blob/master/presentations/schematics.pptx?raw=true), [keynote](https://github.com/poldham/abs_permits/blob/master/presentations/schematics.key?raw=true) or [pdf](https://github.com/poldham/abs_permits/blob/master/presentations/schematics.pdf). The schematics are meant to be viewed as a slide show in presentation mode.

The draft workplan can be downloaded as headings to assist with project planning [here](https://github.com/poldham/abs_permits/blob/gh-pages/annex/draft_workplan.zip?raw=true).

### Who Developed This? 

The original model was written by Dr. Paul Oldham as part of work with Hartmut Meyer and Olivier Rukundo on implementation of the Nagoya Protocol in the Bahamas. The updated version is a joint work in progress and much better for it.

### Financial Support

The model was developed with the support of [The Bahamas Environment, Science & Technology Commission (BEST)](http://www.best.gov.bs) of the Government of the Bahamas under the UNEP/GEF project “Strengthening Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) in the Bahamas" as set out in *Oldham, P (2015) Concepts for an Electronic Monitoring Tool. UNEP/GEF project “Strengthening Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) in the Bahamas”*. The present paper was written with the additional support of the multi-donor [ABS Capacity Development Initiative](http://www.abs-initiative.info) hosted by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH. We express our sincere thanks to the BEST Commission, UNEP/GEF the ABS Capacity Development Initiative, BMZ and GIZ for their support. The views expressed are solely those of the authors and should not be interpreted as reflecting the views of the Government of The Bahamas, BMZ, GIZ or the ABS Initiative.
