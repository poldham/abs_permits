##Introduction

This section provides a draft workplan for governments interested in implementing the model for the online permit and monitoring system outlined in the previous sections.^[The research in this paper was conducted with the support of [The Bahamas Environment, Science & Technology Commission (BEST)](http://www.best.gov.bs) of the Government of the Bahamas under the UNEP/GEF project “Strengthening Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) in the Bahamas" as set out in *Oldham, P (2015) Concepts for an Electronic Monitoring Tool. UNEP/GEF project “Strengthening Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) in the Bahamas”*. The present paper was written with the additional support of [The ABS Capacity Development Initiative](http://www.abs-initiative.info) through the [Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)](https://www.giz.de/en/html/index.html). The views expressed are solely those of the authors and should not be interpreted as reflecting the views of the Government of the Bahamas, the ABS Initiative or GIZ.] The draft workplan is intended to assist countries and authorities interested in implementing the model by identifying tasks for components and elements of the model for resource planning and costing. The draft workplan is intended as a guide and should be adapted in accordance with existing internal capacities and needs. The draft workplan is presented as a set of headings for project planning in the downloadable [Annex](https://github.com/poldham/abs_permits/blob/gh-pages/annex/draft_workplan.zip?raw=true).

The workplan is presented in terms of activities to be carried out in individual countries interested in implementing the system. However, there is a strong case for a network approach between governments seeking to develop and implement the model to meet their needs. 

Network advantages would include:

1. Sharing computer code developed to address specific aspects of the system including specific modules.
2. Sharing lessons learned, guides and protocols.
3. Sharing methods for particular approaches to monitoring, analytics and statistics.
4. Avoiding duplication of effort.
5. Shared capacity building in implementation. 

The draft workplan is divided into two sections:

1. Preparatory Components (labelled A-C).
2. Main Components, elements and tasks (numbered by Components in the model).

The legal component (Component 3) is a cross-cutting issue and an indication of relevant tasks is provided within relevant tasks. The list of legal related tasks is indicative and may require further elaboration. 

## Preparatory Activities

### A: Map Existing Research Permit Systems

*Objective*: Identify and map the existing national research permit system relevant to access and benefit-sharing.

In countries where there is more than one permit authority, it is essential to gain an understanding of the research permit process as a basis for understanding the responsibilities of different permit granting authorities and for consultations on potential ways forward in either improving existing systems or establishing new systems. These activities could logically focus on:

i. Identifying existing permit granting authorities in the country.
ii. The legislative mandates of permit authorities.
iii. Application forms and the terms and conditions set out in permits.
iv. Permit storage conditions.
v. Experience to date in administering permits. 

This scoping exercise will allow the national permit system to be mapped and for consultations between permit granting authorities on appropriate ways forward. 

*Task 1*. Identify the authorities in the country with responsibility for granting ABS related research permits and the details of their mandates with respect to permits.

*Task 2*. Identify the persons responsible for administering permits in the country as a basis for consultations. 

*Task 3*. Consult with permit authorities on experience to date including what has worked for them and problem areas. Discuss options for accessing permit data held by the authority for use in Component B and associated confidentiality issues. 

*Task 4*. Obtain copies and information on: 

a) Standard permit application forms.
b) Copies of the terms and conditions within permits (and any associated agreements).
c) Information on the storage of permit data (electronic, physical, both). This should including the name of any software and formats used for electronic data.
d) Identify who has access to permit data and for what purposes.

*Task 5*. Generate process diagrams for permits within a country. 

*Task 6*. Workshop to discuss existing experiences and the desirability (or otherwise) of a single electronic system serving permit granting authorities. 

*Expected Outcome:* 

1. Clarity on permit granting authorities in the country, their mandates, permit forms and terms and conditions, data administration and storage including the generation of a national permit process diagram. 

2. Agreement on appropriate ways forward in adapting the permit system to serve the needs of permit granting authorities and applicants in response to the entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol. 

### B: Baseline data on scientific and patent literature.

*Objective*: Establish baseline data on scientific research publications and patent activity relevant to access and benefit-sharing. 

The prerequisite for this activity is access to permit data in either physical or (preferably) electronic form. Ideally complete data will be made available to maximise the utility of the outputs. However, if necessary sample data may be used.  

*Task 1*. Obtain copies of permit data (preferably in electronic form) including use of confidentiality agreements and agreement on data storage (see Component A, Task 3). 

*Task 2*. Clean and then tidy permit data into formats that can used to carry out searches of scientific literature and patent databases.

*Task 3*. Obtain data on the scientific literature for a specific country focusing on biodiversity, genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge (indigenous peoples and local communities) as the basis for analysis and refinement. 

*Task 4*. Develop search patterns for patent literature using patent databases and identify appropriate tools and match criteria to distinguish between positive and negative results. 

*Task 5*. Identify, and, as appropriate, develop programmatic tools to facilitate automated literature and patent searches in future that minimise requirements for human intervention. Examples include the programmatic use of crossref or the EPO Open Patent Services or WIPO Patentscope databases and the rOpenSci and biosciences packages in languages such as R or Python. 

*Expected Outcome:* 

1. A clear baseline and overview of existing publication and patent activity that can be linked to existing research permits. 

This outcome will typically involve permits issued prior to the entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol and is intended to create an evidence base and electronic repository of historic data on publications and patent data.  Historic data will also serve as a means to identify key researchers working in a country as a basis for engagement activities to discuss ways of improving the permit and reporting system following the entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol. Note that this outcome fundamentally depends on the availability of permit data for use in searches.

### C: Development and Implementation Plan

*Objective*: Establish a costed development and implementation plan for an online permit and monitoring system . 

*Task 1*. Identify organisations or partners in the country with the technical and programming capacity to develop an electronic permit system consisting of:

- Component 1: An Authorities Portal
- Component 2: An Applicants Portal
- Component 3: Legal Component (cross-cutting)
- Component 4: Monitoring
- Component 5: Reporting
- Component 6: The Core System

*Task 2*: Develop a working model and engage in field testing. 

Develop an experimental working model to test different approaches, identify key tools and for demonstration purposes using dummy data. Note that the purpose of this activity is learning by doing to inform planning and accurate identification of resource requirements not the development of the final system. This task involves a set of sub-tasks. 

*Task 2.1*. Develop one or more working models of the system including identifying solutions using different tools that may be best suited to the diversity of circumstances and existing capacities within a country. 

*Task 2.2*. Consult with staff from authorities involved in checking permit data on the ground (National Parks, Customs, police and others) and identify existing approaches and tools, what already works, problems encountered, and potential solutions. 

*Task 2.3*. Identify how checks by local level authorities can be most effectively linked to an online permit and monitoring system. 

*Task 2.4*. Arrange field tests of solutions such as barcodes, QR code readers, html embed codes etc. with relevant authorities and adapt solutions focusing on meeting actual needs. 

*Task 2.5*. In consultation with relevant national/international collections identify appropriate options for the inclusion of permit identifiers in sample labels and sequence data. A network approach among participating countries is likely to be effective in identifying common solutions. Public collections in Europe interested in registered collection status under [EU Regulation No.511/2014](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32014R0511&from=EN), a category likely to include most major collections in the EU, could be potential partners in testing this approach. 

*Task 3*. Based on experience in Task 1 & 2, including assessment of existing capacities and strengths, identify appropriate software and hardware requirements for the Core System (Component 6).

*Task 4*. Develop a costed development plan over a period of 3 years and projected costs for future years.

*Task 5*. Document experience gained and lessons learned.

*Task 6*. Where the project forms part of a network of participating countries and organisations, deposit working code and documentation in an open access repository (e.g. GitHub) for potential use and further development by partners.  

*Expected Outcome*: 

1. A clear costed development plan for the online system with partners and stakeholders identified over a three year period. 
2. An experimental working model accompanied by documented code, experiences and lessons learned.
3. Identification of software and hardware for the core system based on assessment of existing internal capacity and strengths (e.g. MySQL, Apache, ASP.NET, Node.js etc.).

### Resources List

The figure below provides an indicative list of resources to assist with planning. Note that analytics tools such as VantagePoint and Tableau are available in a range of paid and (in the case of Tableau), free versions. Paid software is included as part of a phased approach from paid to open source software over time. This is also true for databases of the scientific literature and patent databases where commercial tools such as Thomson Innovation offer convenience in data access but significant cost while open source options require significant investments in knowledge of their use (e.g. R or Python resources).
