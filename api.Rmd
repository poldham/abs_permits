The online permit and monitoring system is intended to be built as a REST API. This approach is mainly intended to allow permit authorities, who are frequently in different departments or ministries, to pull or post data to the system. The API approach also allows for authentication of endpoints. 

In general Swagger is the preferred tool for API design and documentation.
